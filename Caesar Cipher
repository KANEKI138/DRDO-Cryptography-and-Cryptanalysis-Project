Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is estimated to date back to the first century BC in the Roman
Empire. Its name comes from the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar, who used this cipher
to encrypt military messages and strategies [1], and it is estimated to be broken in about
the fifth century AD. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher, in which each letter of
the alphabet is moved a certain number of characters to the right. For example, if the
established number is 5, then A will become F, B will become G, C will become H, etc.
In this cipher, the key is represented by the number that the letters are shifted. Note that
the key should be secret, known only by the sender (to encrypt the messages) and by the
receiver (to decrypt the messages). The Caesar cipher is important because it is the basis
for other classical ciphers, such as Vigen√®re. The Caesar cipher with key k = 13 is also
known as Rot13
